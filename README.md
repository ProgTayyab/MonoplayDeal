**Monopoly Deal – Terminal Based Game (C++)
📌 Overview**

This project is a terminal-based implementation of the Monopoly Deal card game, developed in C++. The goal of the project was to apply object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and data structures to build a complete, playable game using core programming principles.

The game runs entirely in the terminal and simulates key mechanics of Monopoly Deal, including player turns, card management, and win conditions.

**🎯 Objectives**

Practice Object-Oriented Programming in C++

Apply data structures for managing game state

Design modular and maintainable code

Implement real-world game logic in a terminal environment

**🧠 Concepts Used**

Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Objects, Encapsulation, Inheritance)

Data Structures (Vectors, Maps, Stacks, etc.)

Game logic and state management

Control structures and modular programming

Input/output handling in terminal

**🕹️ Game Features**

Terminal-based interactive gameplay

Multiple players support

Turn-based game flow

Card distribution and management

Property, action, and money card handling

Win condition checking

Clear and structured game logic

**🛠️ Technologies Used**
